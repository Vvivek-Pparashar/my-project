            "Fun is like insurance, the older you got the more it's costs" insurance is a contract, represented by a
                                  policy, in which an individual or entity/ group receives financial protection or reimbursement against
                                  losses from an insurance company. These(insurance policies) policies are used to protect against the
                                  risk of financial losses, both big and small, that may result from damage to the insured or her property.
                                  As per the Motor Vehicles Act of1988, it is mandatory to take the MOTOR INSURANCE while purchasing any 
                                  type of a vehicle â€“ be it a car or a two-wheeler. As a standard sales procedure, the first insurance comes 
                                  with the purchase of the vehicle and after that you have to get insured by yourself to get a premium plan 
                                  from private company, However, it has been observed that the bike owners typically get somewhat careless
                                  about renewing the insurance on their motorcycle after a couple of claim-free years. Some drivers consider
                                  their good driving skills as an excuse for not bothering with TWO WHEELER INSURANCE. Therfore, 60% people
                                  think insurance is an unnecessary expense, and in case you got late to have a renewal in time you have to
                                  pay 20% more on your premium plan, therefore, it come in result that 10% of thier customer has been
                                  decresing every year. However, the nature of accidents and mishaps is such that they happened unannounced,
                                  to anyone, anywhere. therefore, to get rid of this problem IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development
                                  Authority) has passed some rule and regulation.
<br><br>
                                  IRDA (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority) has allowed the insurers to sell STANDALONE Motor 
                                  Third Party Insurance for two-wheelers for periods of up to three years. For two-wheeler owners, this
                                  means that they do not need to renew their insurance policies every year. Instead, now they can renew 
                                  their third-party insurance policy once in three years. As per the IRDA guidelines, the total premium                                   
                                  charged for the third-party coverage would be thrice the annual third-party premiums and the insurers would
                                  not be allowed to revise these premiums (upwards or downwards) during the period of policy under any
                                  circumstances. Also, once issued, the insurer is not allowed to cancel the standalone third-party cover in 
                                  any circumstances except in case of total loss of the insured vehicle.
                                  <br><br>        
                                  Riding without a valid third-party or comprehensive two-wheeler is a punishable offence. It could lead to 
                                  hefty penalties and even imprisonment. Moreover, once the policy lapses, you will then have to purchase a 
                                  new policy and complete all the paperwork and inspection again. All of this can be easily avoided with the 
                                  help of a multi-year insurance policy. With a single purchase, it keeps you protected against the severe 
                                  consequences of policy-lapse for multiple years. Keeping this in view, having a long-term insurance option
                                  for this segment becomes critical so that the maximum number of vehicles are covered under insurance. This
                                  premium insureance has many advantages. Under this premium insurance people Long Term third party two
                                  wheeler insurance will only cover damage caused by the insured vehicle to another party. It will not pay for 
                                  any damages that are caused to the insured two wheeler. The policy is usually cheaper in comparison to a 
                                  comprehensive bike insurance plan. Apart from this there are various other benefits that a third party 
                                  insurance policy offers the following benefits:
                                  <br><br>
                                  A third-party insurance policy takes care of your financial and legal compulsions that may arise from an 
                                  accident, collision or death. The immediate beneficiary is a third-person instead of the insured and the 
                                  insurer. One of the most significant benefits of timely comprehensive bike insurance renewal is No Claim 
                                  Bonus or NCB accumulation. It allows you to get a discount on the insurance premium if you have not filed 
                                  any claims in the past year. The NCB for 1st claim-free year is 20%, and it could increase up to 50% in 
                                  the 5th claim-free year.
                                  <br><br>
                                  Essentially, long-term Two-Wheeler Insurance is a win-win situation for the consumer as well as the insurers. 
                                  A 5-year insurance policy is a long-term commitment. What if after purchasing, you do not like the services  
                                  of the insurance provider? What if the claim process of the insurer is very complex? In such cases, you can  
                                  cancel your policy anytime you like and switch to a different insurer. The current insurer will refund the  
                                  unutilised premium amount. Additionally, you can transfer your current NCB to the new insurer. You are required 
                                  to get an NCB certificate from your current insurer and purchase the policy from the new insurer before  
                                  cancelling your existing policy. Submit the NCB certificate to the new insurer and your bonus will be transferred 
                                  to the new policy. As can be seen above, long-term two-wheeler insurance policies bring with them a host of 
                                  valuable advantages. If yourinsurance renewal is just around the corner, do consider purchasing a multi-year plan 
                                  and start experiencing all the benefits..
